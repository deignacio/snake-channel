snake multiplayer channel

this was initially written by David Ignacio <dignacio@litl.com>

this was developed using the following:
* flash builder 4 [0]
or
* adobe flex sdk 4.0.0 (not the open source one) [1]
* sun java 1.6 [2]
* ant[3]

and
* the flash 10.0 playerglobal.swc [8]
* the litl as3 sdk core library [4]
* the litl as3 sdk controls [5]
* the litl as3 sdk helpers [6]

to test you'll need:
* adobe air 2 [7]
* the litl as3 sdk simulator [8]

to play you'll need:
* a litl remote (availability tba)
* or the litl remote android app (available any time now)
* or the litl remote iphone app (pending)
* or the remote tab of the simulator (available now)

setting up using open source tools
* install tools needed (adobe flex sdk, java, ant)
* checkout and build (or just install) the as3 sdk core
* checkout and build (or just install) the as3 sdk controls
* checkout and build (or just install) the as3 sdk helpers
* checkout this source (i use ~/checkout/snake-channel)
* copy build.properties.template to build.properties
* modify build.properties to point to sdk paths
    i have the flex sdk at /opt/flex-sdk_4.0.0
    i installed the litl as3 sdk core to /opt/litl-sdk/core
    i installed the litl as3 sdk controls to /opt/litl-sdk/controls
    i installed the litl as3 sdk helpers to /opt/litl-sdk/helpers

building the swf
* cd to the source (cd ~/checkout/snake-channel)
* run ant (ant)
    the default target is build-debug-swf
    this builds a debug version of the swf with extra
    symbols and such
    for information on other ant targets, run
        ant -p

testing/running swf
* install flash debug plugin (/opt/flex-sdk_4.0.0/runtimes/player)
* install adobe air 2 [7]
* install the litl simulator [8]

* run the simulator
* run the swf project in flash builder
* or open the swf in the simulator
    usually it's in ~/checkout/snake-channel/build/deploy/main.swf
* or open the built swf in a browser (i'm using firefox and chromium)

* start up the remote
* connect to the simulator

packaging for submission
* cd to the source (cd ~/checkout/snake-sample-channel)
* run ant target (ant build-release-zip)
   creates ~/checkout/snake-channel/build/deploy.zip for use in the developer site to
   upload the new version of your channel


build artifact layout:
* ${basedir}/build/
  all build artifacts are contained here
* ${basedir}/build/deploy/main.swf
  the swf file created to use while testing
* ${basedir}/build/deploy.zip
  the zip file to use when uploading your channel to litl
